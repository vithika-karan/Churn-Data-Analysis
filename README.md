# Churn-Data-Analysis
Churn Data Analysis is a simple and detailed exploratory data analysis of telecommunication firm's churn dataset. This project is a part of Data Science curriculum at [AlmaBetter](https://www.almabetter.com/).
### Problem Statement
Orange S.A., formerly France Télécom S.A., is a French multinational telecommunications corporation. The Orange Telecom's Churn Dataset, consists of cleaned customer activity data (features), along with a churn label specifying whether a customer canceled the subscription.
Explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for customer churn and come up with ways/recommendations to ensure customer retention.
### Project Files
This project contains one executable file as follows:
* **Telecom_Churn_Analysis_Capstone_Project.ipynb** - Complete Google Collab notebook containing data summary, exploration, visualisations, conclusion and recommendations.
### Project Description
One of the more common tasks in the business world is to try and understand consumer behavior. By understanding the behavior the intent is to better serve them in order for good business growth. Churn Analysis is essentially done to understand the reasons behind a customer’s decision of ‘leaving’ a company, so appropriate measures can be taken in the given time to make them stay.

The work here investigates the reasons behind churn in the dataset provided in the problem statement through Exploratory Data Analysis and makes recommendations for customer retention accordingly.


Exploratory Data Analysis: Exploratory data analysis is a crucial part of data analysis. It involves exploring and analyzing the dataset given to find out patterns, trends and conclusions to make better decisions related to the data, often using statistical graphics and other data visualization tools to summarize the results.
